# Budget application

This is a budget application that helps users easily keep track of expenses for effective budget planning.

You can seed the database with sample expenses:
```
$ rails db:seed
```
*Please be aware that the application was developed exclusively for testing purposes, without deployment to the Heroku and AWS platforms.
You can run the app on a local server:
```
$ rails server
```
